# Insertion sort

> Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.

## steps

1. compare key with each element on the left of it until an element smaller than it is found
2. for descending order, change key<array[j] to key>array[j].
3. place key at after the element just smaller than it.
